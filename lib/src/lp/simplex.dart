/// Termination state of the simplex algorithm
enum SimplexResult { unbounded, optimized }

/// Simplex algorithm
///
/// The input should be normalized to slack form. Let n be the size of the x
/// vector and k be the number of constraints. The input consists of two parts:
/// + Maximization function:     z = v   +  c_1*x_1 +  c_2*x_2 + ... +  c_n*x_n
/// + Constraints for i=1..k:  y_i = b_i + a_i1*x_1 + a_i2*x_2 + ... + a_in*x_n
///
/// Arguments:
/// + [c]: vector of length n containing all maximization coefficients
/// + [a]: matrix of size (n + 1)*k containing all constraints (0 <= b_i)
/// + [xs]: variable belonging to each x_j
/// + [ys]: variable belonging to each y_i
///
/// The goal is to maximize z. The input equation system defines an n-polytope
/// that encompasses the feasible region of the vector x. The simplex algorithm
/// starts at x_i = 0 (the zero vector is always contained because of the
/// constraints on b_i, x_i, y_i) and moves along the edges of the polytope
/// until no move yields a higher value for z or an infinite upper bound is
/// discovered.
